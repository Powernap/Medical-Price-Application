## Review 1

Overall Recommendation: 6
Evaluation Confidence: 3

Question 1: Clinical Value: 7 - good
Comment:With a computer science background, my score should be considered with low weight here.
My general impression is that this work is certainly helpful in predictive medicine, in clinical practice it is probably of a little use as it does not aid a physician to establish a diagnosis or to assist a treatment. So while the clinical value is maybe low at this point in time, the impact of this work on data-driven medicine is good! It would be however exciting to read which new hypotheses the new workflow enabled to formulate as compared to the traditional workflows.

Question 2: Adequate Use of Computer Graphics: 6 - acceptable
Comment:I allow myself to replace the term "computer graphics" with "visual computing" in question 2. I think the combined methodologies are reasonable combination of scientific visualization techniques with infovis and visual analytics techniques coupled with computational machinery from machine learning. These are good engineering works, that help advancing medical milieu, but I have not found a previously non-existing algorithm in the described work, all works are rather describing a system as a novel combination of ad-hoc technologies.

## Review 2

Overall Recommendation: 7
Evaluation Confidence: 2

Question 1: Clinical Value: 6 - acceptable
Comment:The authors present here a set of techniques that go from the data analysis to the development of a set of prototypes for the analysis of cohort data.
From what the authors explain, I believe that this kind of tools have a large potential and will be very useful both analyzing the causing factors causes of several health conditions and to predict certain risk factors.
On the other side, the presented techniques have worked as prototypes, and, as the authors say, there is still quite work to do for the prototypes to become full-featured applications that can be used regularly.

Question 2: Adequate Use of Computer Graphics: 7 - good
Comment:Concerning the Computer Graphics, the techniques presented here combine elements from information visualization and computer graphics.
The techniques have been selected properly, and the novelty seems to come from the way the data is aggregated and how a specific visualization technique is selected for the heterogeneous sources. One of the challenges is the little familiarity of the epidemiologists with the visualization techniques. Like in the previous case, there are still some elements which need to be added to make it a final product.

As a conclusion, I would say that, even that I find there are important strengths in both parts of the proposal (clinical and computer graphics), the proposed methods still need some features to make them more mature.

## Review 3

Overall Recommendation: 6
Evaluation Confidence: 3

Question 1: Clinical Value: 6 - acceptable
Comment:The paper presents an interesting approach to combining images and data for cohort analysis. While the paper is well written and the overall system well explained, it would have been nice to have some compelling use case(s) that underline the utility and value of this approach. Logically, the approach does make sense but it would be nice to have some preliminary data where the actual (interactive) exploration of image and contextual data made a significant difference (break through).

Question 2: Adequate Use of Computer Graphics: 6 - acceptable
Comment:The use of computer graphics is driven by off-the-shelf visualization techniques as well as user interface components to visualize the cohorts. It is a good use of existing techniques / tools. It appears that the system / tool is in its early stage and more clarity of utility will come in the future, potentially bringing proof of the break-through potential then.
